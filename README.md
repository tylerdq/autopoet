# bnamer
bnamer is a little band naming script that draws on the alternative dictionary [2of12id](http://wordlist.aspell.net/alt12dicts-infl-readme/) from 12dicts

## Formats
The script needs to be given a format by feeding it arrangements of parts of speech. The output will print a random part of speech in the order requested. Possible parts of speech include:
* Adjectives (A)
* Conjunctions/prepositions (C)
* Interjections (I)
* Nouns (N)
* Pronouns (P)
* Spoken contractions (S)
* Verbs (V)
* Miscellaneous items (X)

A sample format might be `A V N`, which results in the output `Adjective Verb Noun`

## Some fun outputs from the script (with their formats)
* Extracurricular Converging Potholes - `A V N`
* Graze my Java - `V my N`
* Swarding my Placekickers - `V my N`
